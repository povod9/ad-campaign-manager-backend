# Adcampaign Service

## Description

A REST API for managing advertising campaigns, products, and sellers.  
Built on Spring Boot 4.0.6, MapStruct, Spring Security (JWT authentication), and H2 for local development.

**Security:**  
All business logic is scoped to the resource owner - no seller can access someone else’s products or campaigns.  
All key endpoints require a valid JWT token.  
Only registration and login are public.


The service will run on http://localhost:8080 by default.

---

## ENV/Configuration

**JWT secret and expiration must be set either via environment variables or in application.yaml:**
- `JWT_SECRET` — Secret key for JWT signing (a default is set in application.yaml for local).
- `JWT_EXPIRATION` — Token expiration, in milliseconds (`8600000` by default).
